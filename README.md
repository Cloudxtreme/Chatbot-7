# Overview:
It is an interactive machine learning project where user can ask anything and the chatbot will reply to it.

## API used:
The chatbot is made using chatterbot api.
It is necessary to translate the data in chatterbot api format.
To put it into that format I had to filter my data first.

## Other Details:
I have used corpus movie dataset for the training purpose.But the data contained some unwanted parameters.
To filter the dialouges from the dataset, I have written a simple python program which uses strip and split function.
The file is filtertry.py given above. :+1:

## Also:
I am using tkinter for the front end to enhance user interactivity.
